# SEMIKONG: The First Semiconductor Industry-Specific Large Language Model

SEMIKONG is an open-source, industry-specific large language model (LLM) tailored to the semiconductor domain. It aims to address the unique challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, such as the physics and chemistry of semiconductor devices and processes, by incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the model.

## Key Features

- First industry-specific LLM for the semiconductor domain
- Trained on a comprehensive semiconductor-related text corpus
- Novel pre-training approach leveraging domain-specific knowledge
- Superior performance compared to general-purpose LLMs on industry-relevant benchmarks
- Serves as a valuable foundation for companies to build proprietary models tailored to their needs
